## Project Description
CuraMind AI is an intelligent healthcare software solution developed to streamline and automate medical coding and insurance claims processing. It leverages advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to reduce manual workload, improve accuracy, and enable faster decision-making. CuraMind AI serves medical coders, insurers, patients, and hospital administrators through an integrated platform that includes code extraction, claim recommendations, fraud detection, and predictive analytics for better hospital and treatment insights.It can be used by patients to get best hospitals and treatment suggestions. It can be used by medical insurance companies to generate medical codes to grant insurance with help of AI. It can be used in hospitals to get quick summaries of patients which will be helpful incase of any emergency situations.

## What is the Issue that we are Trying to Address?
The healthcare sector struggles with several inefficiencies in claim management and medical documentation:
- Manual coding of medical records is error-prone and time-consuming.
- Insurance companies experience delays in claims processing, with limited fraud detection.
- Patients are left confused by the complexity of medical insurance and hospital options.
- Hospital administrators lack the tools to streamline operational claims and enhance service quality.

## What is the Proposed Solution?
CuraMind AI addresses the above challenges with a multifaceted solution:
- **Medical Code Extraction**: Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to scan prescriptions, medical documents, and test reports to automatically identify ICD and CPT codes.
- **Smart Claim Engine**: Recommends claim amounts and ensures transparency in claims through data-backed predictions and summaries.
- **Fraud Detection Module**: Applies anomaly detection algorithms to flag fraudulent or inconsistent claims.
- **Hospital and Treatment Recommendation Engine**: Provides patients with personalized hospital suggestions based on treatment history, cost, and success rates.
- **Role-based Dashboards**: Tailored interfaces for different users (Coder, Insurer, Patient, Admin) to improve usability and operational efficiency.
